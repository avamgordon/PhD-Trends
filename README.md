# PhD-Trends
Final group project completed for STAT 3302 (Statistical Modeling) using R and modeling techniques to analyze trends in the number of PhDs awarded from 2008 to 2017. 

I invite you to read our final project report -- all R coding is hidden from the final report for conscieness and reader purposes.
